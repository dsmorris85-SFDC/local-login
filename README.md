This example Node.js application was built to use [Express](http://expressjs.com/), 
[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) to register and login / authenticate users using a username and
password with [form-based authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP%2BHTML_form-based_authentication).

It is designed to use [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the DB, and should be straightforward to get up and running on your local machine.
